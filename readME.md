    Here a couple projects i have worked on. unfortunately not all of them are hosted. I find myself getting drowned in writing codes for the sake of growth. i usually ignore deploying my works (something i look forward to changing), some of them are collaborations and deploying depend on the other team member(s), some are contract jobs and i am unable to publicly share the code repo. i'll try to talk about my works
    
1. Talos cryptocurrency app, (february 2020 - April 2020): This is a collaboration project i worked on with [Tout-saint](https://github.com/john-eleos "John_eleos' repository"). it's a cryptocurrency trading bot that helps users enter and close trades efficiently. so basically a dashboard app and it had a lot of API requests, charts and tables. it was built with react, formik, nodeJS and bootstrap. this was sort of my first project and it really set the groundwork for a other projects i worked on. this was initially deployed on netlify but i guess we ran out of funds so it's on pause for now but we plan to continue and it's also a private repo ðŸ˜ž

2. nirsal agsmeis: this is an important project for me because it's what taught me a lot of what i know about project management and collaboration with other developers. nirsal is an agro-loan investment platform and the aim of the webapp is to reduce the strenuous loan application process in Nigeria. its built using react and typescript, my first encounter in real life. this project is currently hosted on [nirsal.remsys.com](http://nirsal.remsys.com.ng:85/)

3. nirsal admin: this is a different, not entirely, platform from the previous site which is a public site. this is the admin portal and it can only be accessed by the admnistrators of nirsal it uses similar stacks to the previous but offers different fnctionlities. we opted to have the admin on a different for security reasons and also separation of code logic. this is hosted on [nirsaladmin.remsys.com](https://nirsaladmin.remsys.com.ng/)

4. shopify movie challenge: so i applied for the shopify internship. this is a public repoand all details can be found on the [repository](https://github.com/bolajahmad/shopify-movie-awards)

5. Github profile replica: a vanillaJS challenge to replicate the github repository page. my first actual challege with vanilla since i'd always been working with react. the challenge was to use plain vanilla no libraries, i certanly might have opted or jQuery, to access the github api and query it as a graphql query, also my first time. details of the code is [here](https://bolajahmad-git-replica.netlify.app/).
