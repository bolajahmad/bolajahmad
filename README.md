## portfolio

    Here a couple projects i have worked on. you can take a look at the repo too if you're here longer.
    
1. Nirsal Admin: this is a different, not entirely, platform from the previous site which is a public site. this is the admin portal and it can only be accessed by the admnistrators of nirsal it uses similar stacks to the previous but offers different fnctionlities. we opted to have the admin on a different for security reasons and also separation of code logic. this is hosted on [nirsaladmin.remsys.com](https://nirsaladmin.remsys.com.ng/)

2. Moneypay: basic setup of a microservice application using NodeJS, Typescript, Express, React, RabbitMQ, JWT, MongoDB, Mongoose. This app builds a microservice aplication that can be used ro create a digital wallet, fund the wallet and transfer funds at any time.

3. Plutus Cardano NFT Application: i wrote a smart contract to mint NFTs as a collection on cardano using Haskell and Plutus. Test cases are written using shell scripts to communicate with testnet daedalus wallet. Follow ReadME guide for more. [https://github.com/bolajahmad/cnft-marketplace-plutus](View)

4. Rust Journey: I am learning rust, abd substrate. But this is my journey in rust so far. [https://github.com/bolajahmad/rust-journey](View)

5. Github profile replica: a vanillaJS challenge to replicate the github repository page. my first actual challege with vanilla since i'd always been working with react. the challenge was to use plain vanilla no libraries, i certanly might have opted or jQuery, to access the github api and query it as a graphql query, also my first time. details of the code is [here](https://bolajahmad-git-replica.netlify.app/).
